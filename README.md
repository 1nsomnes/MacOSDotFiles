## About 
These are my dotfiles for, Mac, this repository is intended to make it easy for me to transfer some of my configurations when I 1) factory reset my laptop or 2) get a new macbook (ie for work). 

## Shell
Since I own a M4 MacBook Pro, the default shell is [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), I think it is an excellent shell and I have not felt the need to get anything else. I use [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) but I would recommend using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) if I had to make that decision again. In both OhMyZsh and Prezto, I use the [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt theme.

## Nvim
I am not a Vim purist, I make it look nice and I use plugins to recreate IDE features.

## Tmux
[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux) is one of my all time favorite CLI tools, I primarily use it to manage different sessions.
